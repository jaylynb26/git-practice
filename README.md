Something I found interesting about this article was how the interviewee talked about how collaborative software engineering is. I think a lot of people think that working with tech is very cold and _individual_, and perhaps in some ways it is, but the more I learn about the industry, the more I realize how much teamwork is involved. It was also interesting to read about the interviewee's perspective on knowing what you want to do within the industry and how much learning and studying goes into interviews, switching jobs, or working on a project. There's so much change and so much information out there to gain, so even if you're in the industry for a decade you'll _still_ have something new to learn.

I agree with you. It is hard to realize how much collaboration is involved in this industry unless we learn and work in it. The tech industry is always evolving, new tools and language are coming out, so we are constantly working with and learning new thing. What's more, it is hard for an engineer to know everything he/she works on, so it is always nice to consult peers for more information if there is something blocking.
